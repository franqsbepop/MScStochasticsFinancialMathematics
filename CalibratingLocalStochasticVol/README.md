# Abstract of master research thesis  titled "Calibration of Local Stochastic Volatility models in a conic finance setting using Artificial Neural Networks"
By Diogo Franquinho

In this thesis we study the calibration of Local Stochastic Volatility (LSV) models using
artificial neural networks. We leverage the proposed methodology and techniques
presented in C. Cuchiero, W. Khosrawi, and J. Teichmann. “A generative adversarial
network approach to calibration of local stochastic volatility models”. In: Risks 8.4
(2020), p. 101 to seamlessly approximate the map between market prices and model
parameters using a feed-forward neural network. The methodology is fully data-driven
and allows us to circumvent the strenuous computation of Dupire’s formula and avoids
the interpolation of the volatility surface. Furthermore, we extended the method to
handle the two-price system described in the framework of conic finance. Consequently,
the directional nature of prices observed in markets is taken into account, allowing us to
consider only information available in the market to derive calibrated bid and ask prices.
Our method is evaluated through a numerical analysis that involves calibrating it with
real market data and comparing the results against a benchmark model and method.

## Documentation 
Will follow in the near future (this version requires tensorflow 1.13 and python 3)
If the environment is set up correctly, the following command should start all computations needed for the statistical test described in the paper:
```console
user@host:~$ python3 stat_test.py
```
